# An Automatic Github Pull Shark Achievement Collector
## How to use

1. Fork this repo.
2. Open status.md and  put the number of pull requests that you have to start from.
3. For this action to work you must explicitly allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests. This setting can be found in a repository's settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions.
4. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and name it as PAT [in Github secrets](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/assets/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows.md)
5. Go to .github/workflows > merge.yaml and change the creator from Anurag-gg to your username
6. Go to Actions section and click on "I understand my workflows,go ahead and enable them"
7. You can disable the workflow once you get all the achievements (like i did)
